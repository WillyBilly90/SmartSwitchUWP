# SmartSwitchUWP
An Universal Windows App which can power on/off HomeWizard (lite) switches. You can change the layout, classes and so on, for your own app.

This works with this switch, which I bought at Action: https://tweakers.net/ext/f/pIdoKRaB9WtitlIJw5OkkwnJ/full.jpg

It should work with other HomeWizard devices, which are connected to internet, too.
The only thing you have to do is create functions for your own devices, like Somfy devices.
